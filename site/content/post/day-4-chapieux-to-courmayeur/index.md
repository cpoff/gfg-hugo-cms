date: 2024-01-24T17:47:38.977Z
description: We take the bus to Ville des Glaciers and continue on the trail to
  the Refuge Mottets. The Refuge Mottets is situated in a great position below
  the Col du Seigne 2516m, although we climb steeply at times we soon find
  ourselves over the col & across French/Italian border into Italy. We then make
  a descent into the stunning Val Veny with easy walking through the hanging
  valleys to Lac Combal. From here we descend La Visaille and take the shuttle
  bus to Courmayeur.
