description: Today we have two options as we can take the route directly to the
  Col du Balme from Trient or through alpine woodland to the Alpage of Tseppes,
  Catogne and on to the Col du Balme 2191m and the Swiss/French border. From the
  Col, we then make our descent to the hamlet of Le Tour and across pastureland
  to the village of Argentiere and our hotel accommodation for the evening.
